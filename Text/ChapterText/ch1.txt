[OpenMidLeft][LoadGreenSoldier]
Halt! Who goes there?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I am Prince Dominic of Esnia.[A][N]
I must speak with King Rombus[N]
of Udrein. Is he available?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
His Highness is currently preoccupied,[N]
but he should be available shortly.[A][N]
You can wait inside. Please, follow me.[A][X]

## Ch1OpeningText2
[OpenMidRight][LoadDominic]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadGreenSoldier]
You and your companions[N]
can wait in this room.[A][N]
We will let you know when[N]
His Highness is available.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
All right, thank you.[A][X]

## Ch1OpeningText3
[OpenMidRight][LoadDominic]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadRay]
[OpenLeft][LoadElliot]
We must locate the[N]
temple on the premises.[A][N]
Is everyone versed on the plan?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I'll keep King Rombus busy.[N]
Ray, duck in that room there.[A][N]
Once I've left for my audience,[N]
find your way behind the throne room.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
Sure thing, boss.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
The rest of you, search[N]
the front of the building.[A][N]
You're much less[Beat] covert,[A][N]
so try to stay out of the areas[N]
you're not supposed to be in.[A]
[OpenLeft]
Of course, Milord.[A][N]
But I must insist, are you[N]
sure this is a good idea?[A][N]
If you are caught, the consequences[N]
would be most dire[Beat][A]
[OpenMidRight]
We don't have a choice, Elliot.[A][N]
If the rumors are true,[A][N]
we cannot allow the resurrection[N]
of the Goddess Carthena.[A][N]
There is no risk too high.[A][X]

Well, if it isn't young Dominic.[A][N]
What can I do for you today?[A][X]
